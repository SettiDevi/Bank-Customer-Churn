# Bank Customer Churn Analysis


# Problem Statement
Customer churn is a critical challenge for banks, as retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. High attrition rates can lead to revenue loss, reduced customer lifetime value, and lower market competitiveness.

This project aims to analyze 10,000 bank customer records to identify key factors contributing to churn. This analysis is structured around four key questions.
1. What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners? Can churn be predicted using the variables in the data?

2. What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?

3. Is there a difference between German, French, and Spanish customers in terms of account behavior?

4. What types of segments exist within the bank'sÂ customers?
